# Phin

Phin is a simple collection of PHP packages which ties together Illuminate components to make simple PHP sites.

The goal is to have sites created with Phin have maximum similarities with Laravel applications while minimizing the code needed. Hopefully this results in a thin PHP site framework that is easily maintainable (to keep up with Illuminate component updates) and can be easily migrated to a full Laravel application if the site requires the full set of features.

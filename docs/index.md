## Overview

Phin is a simple collection of PHP packages which ties together Illuminate components to make simple PHP sites.

### Goal
The goal is to have sites created with Phin have maximum similarities with Laravel applications while minimizing the code needed. Hopefully this results in a thin PHP site framework that is easily maintainable (to keep up with Illuminate component updates) and can be easily migrated to a full Laravel application if the site requires the full set of features.

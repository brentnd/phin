## Site Setup & Initialization

Setting up a new Phin site with the default structure is painless after Phin is installed.

Create a new site:
```
$ phin init my-site
```
This will create a new directory `my-site` where Phin is initialized.

Initialize Phin from an existing directory:
```
$ phin init
```
This will setup your current directory as a Phin site.

## Bulma Themes
The basic site comes stock with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). To add some alternate styling as a starting point for the Phin site, use the `theme` command.

Switch to Bulmawatch's Cosmo theme:
```
$ phin theme cosmo
```
> The default sass setup is ready for themes to be installed and doesn't require modifying any scss files or your gulpfile.

Run `gulp` to compile the new assets and the site will have the new theme.
